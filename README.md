# CPP course - Exercise 1

### Introduction
This is my first project in the CPP course.
This is the first and last exercise with C language.


### The mission
Implement a general adaptive array in the C language. 
>Adaptive array - is an array that changes its size so that any reference to a negative index is valid. When you refer to an index where no value has been placed then NULL is returned. There is no preliminary information on the type of elements that will enter the array.
 
### ADT Main Methods
- [x] **CreateAdptArray** 
  >Initializes an empty array (without elements).
- [x] **DeleteAdptArray**
  >Free the memory of the array (elements included).
- [x] **SetAdptArrayAt** 
  >Receives an index and a element and saves a copy of the element in the requested index.
  >If the index does not exist, replase the old array with a new resized one.
- [x] **GetAdptArrayAt** 
  >Receives an index and return the element in the requested index.
- [x] **GetAdptArrayAtSize** 
  >Returns the arrays size
- [x] **PrintDB** 
  >Prints all the elements in the array.
